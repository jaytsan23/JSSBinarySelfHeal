Added a random delay to the LaunchDaemon
    There is a 10 minute random delay that was added to the LaunchDaemon.  I wanted to move away from the possibility of every client trying to run a policy in the Self Heal at the same time.
    
Modified the if statements to no longer use a like variable.

    example of this change is below:
    Previous:
    if [[ ${check} =~ "The JSS is available" ]]
    
    Now:
    if [[ ${check} == "The JSS is available" ]]
    
I modified my variables to use grep and cut to extract what I would expect to see in terminal running a command using the JAMF binary.  I then was able to use "==" to match my variable to the expected command output.

I have tested the Self Heal process against JSS 9.96 and still seeing success with the current process. No changes have been made to this workflow at this time.

Thanks to Sam Novak, I have added a check to view the size of the client binary.  There are reports that client machines when upgrading to 9.96 are receiving a parital/corrupt binary.  A re-enroll fixes this issues, so that has now been added to the Self Heal script as a function check.

1) I have added some new changes to the Self Heal process.  I have added an echo of the jamf client binary version.  We will now see the version of the binary in the Self Heal log.
2) I add the -noPolicy flag to the reenroll calls using the invite code.  This should help out with managed devices not trying to run enrollment complete policies when they need to be reenrolled.
